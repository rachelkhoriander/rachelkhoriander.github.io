# Authenticating with GitHub

Welcome to the first of a series of tutorials on using the GitHub API. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use GitHub's API to authenticate users to your own website, as demonstrated through a simple PHP application. Benefits of using GitHub to authenticate include:

- less development time
-	less code to implement
- reduced maintenance

Using simple PHP, we can focus in on the integration process without complicating the issue by introducing unfamiliar frameworks. Using PHP also allows us to avoid exposing sensitive data through client-side code. 

Throughout this tutorial, we have kept the code simple, so you will need to create your own error handling.
