# Authenticating with GitHub

Welcome to the first of a series of tutorials on using the GitHub API. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use GitHub's API to authenticate users to your own website, as demonstrated through a simple PHP application. 

Benefits of using GitHub to authenticate include:

- less development time
-	less code to implement
- reduced maintenance

Using simple PHP, we can focus in on the integration process without complicating the issue by introducing unfamiliar frameworks. Using PHP also allows us to avoid exposing sensitive data through client-side code. 

Throughout this tutorial, we have kept the code simple, so you will need to create your own error handling.

## How Does GitHub Authentication Work?

Like many other sites, GitHub uses a security framework called OAuth to allow users to grant third-party applications access to their GitHub data without giving them the password. To accomplish this, GitHub’s authorization server issues access tokens to third-party clients. When a user logs on to the system and provides credentials that authenticate against the authentication database, the logon service generates the access token, which is then used by the third party to access protected resources hosted by GitHub.

The basic process is as follows:

1. The third-party client initiates and redirects the user to GitHub.
2. The user authenticates.
3. GitHub redirects the user to the client, providing an authorization code.
4. The client exchanges the code for an access token.
5. The client accesses the API using the user’s access token.

### What is an Access Token?

An access token is a piece of data that accompanies a request to a server and is verified for authenticity before the server responds to the request. The third-party application provides a key, or _secret_, along with the token to allow the server to decode and verify it. Without the correct secret, the token is useless.
