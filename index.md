# Authenticating with GitHub

If you don’t mind your application depending on a third-party authentication provider, you can use GitHub’s API to outsource your authorization server. Benefits of this strategy include:

- less development time
-	less code to implement
- reduced maintenance

In this tutorial, you will learn to integrate GitHub’s OAuth authentication method with your own website, as demonstrated through a simple PHP application.

By using simple PHP, we can focus in on the integration process without complicating the issue by introducing unfamiliar frameworks. PHP also allows us to avoid exposing sensitive data through client-side code. 

Throughout this tutorial, we have kept the code simple, so you will need to create your own error handling.
